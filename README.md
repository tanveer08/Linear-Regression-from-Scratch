# Linear-Regression-from-Scratch
Linear Regression from Scratch in Machine Learning
Developed a linear regression model from scratch, encompassing data generation, weight estimation, and
prediction functions, and acquired valuable knowledge in regression, optimization, and statistical analysis
\- Employed gradient descent optimization for weight estimation, considering L2 regularization \\
â—¦ Gained insights into the relationships between training and validation NRMSE with different factors
