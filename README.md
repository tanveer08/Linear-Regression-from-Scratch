# Linear-Regression-from-Scratch
Linear Regression from Scratch in Machine Learning
1. Developed a linear regression model from scratch, encompassing data generation, weight estimation, and
prediction functions, and acquired valuable knowledge in regression, optimization, and statistical analysis
2. Employed gradient descent optimization for weight estimation, considering L2 regularization \\
3. Gained insights into the relationships between training and validation NRMSE with different factors
